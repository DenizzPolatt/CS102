// of space and has Bi Metacritic score. Metacritic score is between 0 and 100. A high
// score signals high-quality games. Mikeâ€™s aim is to maximize the Metacritic score of
// the games on his computer. Write a recursive function that takes an array of games
// as input and returns the scores of the games he should download to achieve the
// maximum score. Note that he can either download or not download, partially
// downloading a game is not possible. In addition, he can download each game at
// most once.
